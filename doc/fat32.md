## Introduction

This file is a work in progress.  
The system uses an SD-card for accessing files during boot-up and during operation.

URLs used for reference include:  
https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/fat32.html  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system  
https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/fs/fat/fat-1.html (LFN)  

We require the ability to interface with the FAT32 file system (located on the sdcard), using both low-level and high-level sub-routines.

This document describes:  
* the common understanding of FAT32, and
* details of HOW-WE-IMPLEMENT both the low-level and high-level sub-routines.

## Hardware overview

A block diagram showing the hardware and firmware that is used to implement the FAT32 file access is shown below.

## Memory Layout

There are a number of memory-mapped registers:
```
$D680 - SD-controller status/command

            fastio_rdata(7) <= half_speed;
            fastio_rdata(6) <= sdio_error;
            fastio_rdata(5) <= sdio_fsm_error;
            fastio_rdata(4) <= sdhc_mode;
            fastio_rdata(3) <= sector_buffer_mapped;
            fastio_rdata(2) <= sd_reset;
            fastio_rdata(1) <= sdio_busy;
            fastio_rdata(0) <= sdio_busy;
```
The $D680 register is not fully understood, but is believed to be as follows:
When reading from $D680, the above status-information is recieved from the sd-controller.

When writing to $D680, the below control-information is given to the sd-controller.
```
$00 - reset the sdcard
$01 - cancel reset
$10 - reset the sdcard (with flags)
$11 - cancel reset (with flags)
$02 - read the sector pointed to at sd_address[3..0] into the sector_buffer
$03 - write the sector_buffer to the sector pointed to at sd_address[3..0]
$40 - clr sdhc mode
$41 - set sdhc mode
$42 - clr half speed mode
$43 - set half speed mode
$81 - set sector_buffer mapped
$82 - clr sector_buffer mapped
```
The above info sourced from sdcardio.vhdl

```
$D681 - sd_address  LOW-Byte
$D682 - sd_address  mid-Byte
$D683 - sd_address  mid-Byte
$D684 - sd_address HIGH-Byte
```
These registers are to control the sd-controller. You write data to these registers. Reading makes no sense(?).
```
An address of $1BC00800 would be stored in these registers as:
$D681 - $00
$D682 - $08
$D683 - $C0
$D684 - $1B
```
```$D685-$D68F``` - are not currently understood, but seem to be related to the sdcard.

As specified in "kickstart.a65", memory location ```$BB00-$BBFF``` contains data describing the file systems collected. This data is stored in the dos_disk_table.  
This table is #$FF bytes in size, divided into 8x sections.  
Each section is therefore #$20 bytes in size.  
Refer to [dos_disk_table](#dos_disk_table) below for details.  

The next page in memory is ```$BC00-$BCFF```, which contains data used for processing the file system. Entries include:
```
dos_disk_count
dos_disk_cwd_cluster
dos_dirent_longfilename
dos_dirent_shortfilename
dos_requested_filename
dos_file_descriptors
dos_current_file_descriptor
dos_error_code
```
<i>The next 2x pages in memory is ```$BDxx-$BExx```, which are not relevant to the FAT32 file system.</i>

The last page in KICKSTART-memory is ```$BFxx-$BFxx```, which is the Zero-Page (ZP) for the Hypervisor. Entries include:
```
dos_scratch_vector
dos_scratch_byte_1
zptempv2
checkpoint_y
sdcounter
```
This area can be used for temporary variables or ZP-adressing.

The 512-byte buffer is mapped to ```$DE00``` and aliased as "sd_sectorbuffer". This buffer therefore runs through to ```$DE00+$200=$DFFF```.

## SDCARD FAT32 Overview

There is assembly code in kickstart.a65 that is executed during boot, and this code is also accessible when the machine starts up.  
The kickstart assembly code is processes by the processor just like any other normal program running on the machine.  
The kickstart assembly code interfaces to the SDCARD controller using just 5x memory-mapped registers and a 512-byte shared buffer.  
The 5x registers used to interface the SDCARD controller are ```$D680-$D684```.  

```D680``` seems not aliased, but is found in the iomap.txt, and is a control/status register between assembly code and the VHDL SDCARD firmware.
```D681-3``` are aliased as "```sd_address_byte{0-3}```", and are mapped in directly to the SDCARD CONTROLLER.  

To perform a read from the SDCARD, you setup the 4x "sd_address_bytes" to the sector you want, and toggle a bit on the $D680 register. When the SDCARD CONTROLLER is done, a bit in $D680 becomes clearer (or set, i forget).
Then, you need to switch the 512-buffer, performed by calling the "sd_map_sectorbuffer" subroutine.  

Upon startup, basically the KICKUP code performs the following:  

1. resets the SDCARD
1. reads the Master Boot Record (very first chunk of the card)
1. inspects the partition table in the MBR
1. for each partition (and there are four primary partitions)
  1. inspects the file-system and check for a FAT32 partition type
  1. if it is FAT32, it looks further into the Volume ID and performs some checks
  1. if it is FAT32, accepts this partition and records information about it.
1. for a detailled walkthrough of the above 5-steps, see ##below##
1. displays on-screen some information about the SDCARD,
1. loads some files from SDCARD into memory, including CHARROM and KERNALROM, refer to ##LOAD##
1. optionally mounts a disk-image is it if found, refer to ##MOUNT##
1. then JUMPs to the reset-vector within the Kernal.

## SDCARD FAT32 Details

The following initialisation sequence is followed:  

1. reset the sdcard, refer to ##sdreset
1. try and read the Master Boot Record (MBR), refer to ##readmbr
1. scan the MBR and look for partitions, refer to ##scanparts
1. record details of any FAT32 partitions found
1. leave behind some information in a data-structure to inform other sub-routines what (if any) file-system is accessable, refer to ##dos_disk_table

To load a file from the SDCARD, you need to:  

1. setup a pointer and then call the "dos_setname" function,
1. setup the "dos_file_loadaddress" pointer to define where the file is loaded to,
1. call "dos_readfileintomemory" and check the status bit when it returns.

When the "dos_readfileintomemory" function is called, the following things happen:  

1. search the partition for a matching filename
  1. when file is found, leave a pointer pointing to its location
1. close the file
1. open the file
1. map in the sectorbuffer
1. LOOP#1: read a sector
1. LOOP#2: copy the sector (200 bytes) into the load-address, loop to LOOP#2 until done
1. advance to the next sector, and check if more data to load from file, if so, goto LOOP#1.
1. close the file

-------------------------------------------
## sdreset

The SD-card reset function (sdreset:) is situated in the kickstart code.  
Basically, it tries to see if the sdcard is high-capacity (SDHC) or not (SD).  
Currently SDHC is not working. Currently SD is working.  
Basically, it clears the reset-bit in $D680 then delays for a number of clock-cycles (sdtimeoutreset:). It then checks to see if the sd-controller is ready (sdreadytest:) by checking if bit-0 and bit-1 are set in $d680. Then, it sets the reset-bit in $D680 then again delays, and waits for the sd-controller to become ready.  

The routine then waits a while (re2done:), and maps in the sector buffer. It issues a 'read' by writing $02 into $D680 then waits for the sd-controller to complete the read.  
Before returning, it sets the carry flag to indicate success.  
Ben-401 suggests that the sdcard-resetting should be auto-performed by the sd-controller.

## readmbr
The "readmbr:" routine is only called during the kickstart process. It is likely that this routine will be called more-than-once to allow hot-swap of sdcards.  
This routine first calls "sdreset:", followed by setting the sd_address to $00000000. It then jumps to the "sd_readsector:" routine below.  
Also please refer to the "dos_read_mbr:" routine.  

## sd_readsector
This routine is called many times throughout the disk-access.  
It issues a command to the sd-controller, to read the sector on the sdcard pointed to by the sd_address[3..0].  
When reading the MBR, the sd_address is $00000000.  
Basically, the most direct path (without errors is):  

1. check if the card is busy (read $D680.0)
1. ask for the sector to be read (write $02 -> $d680)
1. wait for sd-controller to become ready (not-busy)
1. at "rsread:" i think there is another check to see if the sd-controller is busy (redundant)
1. then a check if $200 (512) bytes were read. NOTE that the reference to "d689" is not understood.
1. before returning, it sets the carry flag to indicate success.  

During the above routine, many errors/abnomalities may occur and the execution path may branch to a delay because the sdcard was not ready, or if the incorrent number of chars read was returned.

At this point, the MBR (sector $00000000) would be in the sector_buffer.
Continuing on through the kickstart boot-process, execution would continue at "gotmbr:".

## gotmbr
Calls "dos_clearall:" which marks the four file-descriptors as empty. Refer to ##file-descriptors.  
Then calls "dos_read_partitiontable:" which is described in detail below.  
At this point, the four primary-partitions on the sdcard would have been examined, and their details stored in the "dos_disk_table:" (see below).  
Then this routine attempts to change-directory-into the "dos_default_disk" by calling "dos_cdroot" function. This is described in detail below.  

If the "dos_cdroot:" function returns true, then the MEGA65 has file-system properties and files etc can be loaded (and 'saved' in the future). In this case, the kickstart execution continues at "mountsystemdiskok:" where files are loaded from the FAT32 partition marked as the "dos_default_disk".  

This concludes the *toplevel* description of the kickstart-code with respect to the fat32/sdcard implementation.  
Details below are for the *lower-level* description of the kickstart-code with respect to the fat32/sdcard implementation.  

===================================================================
===================================================================

## dos_read_partitiontable
Following "gotmbr:", the partition table is examined.  

First, some data-structures are cleared by calling "dos_initialise_disklist:". This routine just sets the dos_disk_count to zero.  
Then, the "dos_read_mbr:" routine is called, which is very similar to the "readmbr:" routine above. I suggest that some re-organisation could be done here. Basically this just sets sd_address to $00000000 and calls the "sd_readsector" routine then calls "sd_map_sectorbuffer:". Refer below for details on the "sd_map_sectorbuffer" routine.  
Then, the MBR is again sitting in the sector_buffer.  

It first checks for the signature $AA55 in location $1FE of the MBR.  
It then looks at each of the four partition entries, located at $1BE, $1CE, $1DE and $1EE respectively. For each entry, it calls "dos_consider_partition_entry:" which is detailled below. Basically it just checks is it looks like a FAT32 partition and if so, records special information about that partition into the data-structure called "dos_disk_table". Refer below for details of the "dos_disk_table" and the "dos_disk_openpartition:" routine.  

## dos_consider_partition_entry
This routine makes use of a preset vector (or pointer) located in "dos_scratch_vector", which points to the start of the partition entry to be considered. Offsets in the Y-register are then used to access information in the partition entry.  
First, a check that the $04'th byte is either $0B or $0C denoting FAT32. If so, execution continues at "partitionisinteresting:". If not, the routine returns.  

At "partitionisinteresting:", we begin to record details about the partition from the MBR's partition-entry into our dos_disk_table.  
We index through the dos_disk_table using the X-register.  
We populate the following fields (refer dos_disk_table for details):  

at "dcpe1:"
```
dos_disk_tableoffset with source_data (description)
+00,01,02,03         with MBR:partition_address+$08 (partition_lba_begin)
+04,05,06,07         with MBR:partition_address+$0C (number_of_sectors)
```

We then call "dos_disk_openpartition:" which populates other fields in the dos_disk_table from data within the partition itself (ie not from the MBR). Refer ##dos_disk_openpartition below for this detail.  

We then examine the MBR:partition_address+$00 (boot_flag) and see if the partition is bootable. NOTE that only one primary partition on a device can be bootable. If the partition is bootable, we record in "dos_default_disk:" the value of the entry we are populating within the dos_disk_table (ie $00..$07).  
NOTE that this logic does not seem to be correct.  



## dos_disk_openpartition
This routine relies on the "dos_disk_count" to be set to a valid value, namely the partition entry within the "dos_disk_table" that we are about to open.  
Additionally, it is assumed that the "dos_disk_table" for this entry already has the data populated at offsets +$00 and +$04 within the dos_disk_table.  

This routine looks into the "Volume ID" of the specified partition, which is pointed to by the address stored in "partition_lba_begin" within offset +00 of the dos_disk_table.  

At "ddop1:", the "partition_lba_begin" is copied from the dos_disk_table into the sd_address[3..0] registers.  
In our example, the value at "partition_lba_begin" is "$00000800" and has units of 'sector'.  

NOTE that there is a difference between SD and SDHC cards, namely that the SD cards are accessed by byte-address, whereas the SDHC are accessed directly by their sector-address. In this regard, we need to convert the sector-address now in sd_address[3..0] to the byte-address. We do this using the "sd_fix_sectornumber:" routine which just multiplies the sector-address by $200. Further details of this are below in ##sdcardmode, but basically results in the byte-address of $00100000.  

Then the sdcard is issues with the read-command, which reads the sector at the location within the sd_address[3..0], followed by mapping the sector_buffer.  

Now, in a similar way to the MBR being examined, the Volume-ID will now be examined at about "ddop1a:".  
First, a check is performed to see if the signature bytes $AA55 appear at the end of the sector.  

Then, the byte at offset-11 is checked for ZERO.  
BG does not agree with this.  

Then, the number-of-FATs is stored into the dos_disk_table at offset +$17.  
```+17 with VID:+$10 (number_of_fats)```

Then, the number of reserved-sectors (2 bytes) is stored into the dos_disk_table at offset +$0D.  
```+0D,0E with VID:+$0E (number of reserved (system) sectors)```

Then, the number of sectors-per-fat (4 bytes) is stored into the dos_disk_table at offset +$09.  
```+09,0A,0B,0C with VID:+$24 (number of sectors per fat)```  

Then, a check is made to see if the number-of-reserved-clusters is less than 255. It does this by checking the next three bytes and ensuring those are zero. This is just before the "ddop11ok:" label.  
Ben401 suggests that this check is actually checking the root-directory-first-cluster, which is not related to the number-of-reserved-clusters.  

Then, the root-directory-first-cluster (4 bytes) is stored into the dos_disk_table at offset +$0F.  
```+0F with VID:+$2C (root-directory-first-cluster)```  
Ben401: why only one byte when the address is four bytes.  

Then, at around "ddop2:", a calculation is made to find the cluster_0 of the root-directory.  
The formula used is "fs_fat32_system_sectors + (2x number_of_fats) + fs_start_sector"  

First, "fs_fat32_system_sectors[1.0]" is copied into dos_disk_table[18-19], then upper two bytes set to zero.  
Second, added to dos_disk_table[18-1B] is the number of sectors per one fat.  
Third, added to dos_disk_table[18-1B] is the number of sectors per one fat, yes this is done twice because there are two FATs.  

Fourth, we do something strange. We calculate the number_of_data_sectors being equal to "total number of sectors in the partition" minus the "number of reserved sectors". BG does not agree with this calculation. The code suggests:  
```
dos_disk_table[12..15] = "number_of_sectors_in_partition" minus "dos_disk_table[18..1B]"
```
NOTE that "dos_disk_table[18..1B]" currently holds the value calculated above in 'Third, ...'  
NOTE that this calculation suggests that it clobbers a value in dos_disk_table[16], but I cannot see that it clobbers anything.  

Then, the number of sectors-per-cluster (1 byte) is stored into the dos_disk_table at offset +$16. This is at "get_sec_per_cluster:".  
```+16 with VID:+$0D (sectors-per-cluster)```  

Then, ad "ddop14:", I do not follow what is going on.  

At "ddop_gotclustercount:", an apparently clobbered variable gets re-instated (dos_disk_table[16]=fs_fat32_sectors_per_cluster}  

Then, at about "ddop16:", the code seems to copy the four bytes of "rootDirFirstCluster" and store each over the top of the other at dos_disk_table+$10.  
```+10 with rootDirFirstCluster.```  
BG: Yes, this does seem to clash with dos_disk_table+$0f  
NOTE that dos_disk_table+$11 seems to never get set.  

Then, just before "dos_return_success:", the value in dos_disk_table+$08 is set to indicate the type of file-system just parsed.
+08 with $0f (fs_type_and_source)  

The "dos_disk_openpartition" function then returns.  

## dos_disk_table
Each section of the dos_disk_table is $20 bytes, allowing for 8 entries. (Q: why 8x when there are only four primary partitions on a sdcard?, A:to allow other devices to appear like /dev/sdc3 and /dev/sdd1 for example).  

Each section is made up as follows: (sourced from the "kickstart.a65 file describing $BB00)  

When accessing one-of-the-eight entries, you first need to get the value in "dos_disk_table_offset:", then multiply that value by $20 (left-shift 5x times). Then add to that result the desired offset specified in an alias located at "fs_dos_disk_table_offsets:".  

Basically,
```
Offsets        Description
+00,01,02,03 = starting sector (fs_start_sector:)
+04,05,06,07 = sector_count (fs_sector_count:)
+08          = file-system type (fs_type_and_source:)
+09,0A,0B,0C = FAT32 specific, length of fat (fs_fat32_length_of_fat:)
+0D,0E       = FAT32 specific, system sectors (fs_fat32_system_sectors:)
+0F          = FAT32 specific, reserved clusters (fs_fat32_reserved_clusters)
+10,11       = FAT32 specific, root directory cluster (fs_fat32_root_dir_cluster:)
+12,13,14,15 = FAT32 specific, cluster count 
+16          = FAT32 specific, sectors per cluster (fs_fat32_sectors_per_cluster:)
+17          = FAT32 specific, # copies of the fat (fs_fat32_fat_copies:)
+18,19,1A,1B = FAT32 specific, first sector of data cluster zero (fs_fat32_cluster0_sector:)
+1C,1D,1E,1F = FAT32 specific, unallocated
```

## sd_map_sectorbuffer
There are two functions, "sd_map_sectorbuffer:" and "sd_unmap_sectorbuffer:".  
These functions just either store #$81 or #$82 respectively into the sdcard-control-register of $D680.  
I understand that the $D680 register is mapped directly to the sd-card-controller, and that these functions may swap the pointers between the two 512-byte buffers.  

## dos_cdroot
This function does some sanity-checks on the chosen "dos_default_disk", and stores values in "dos_disk_cwd_cluster[3..0]".  
I do not think that the "dos_disk_cwd_cluster" registers are currently used.  
I do not think that this routine impacts the current code at all.  

## dos_default_disk
This is a register that holds an index into the dos_disk_table. It should have values between "00" and "07" as we currently only allow 8x disk-devices.

## sdcardmode

There are four dos-file-descriptors. Each is 16-bytes.
A dos-file-descriptor is invalid/unallocated when the first byte is $FF.

```
dos_file_descriptors:
	.byte $FF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0	; each is 16 bytes
```

When you try and load a file, first the directory is searched for the filename.  
The directory (or better referred to as FAT) is searched.  
When the FAT is searched, each $20-byte entry is examined.  

```
Currently:
- check for attrib=0f -> goto LFN (long file name) <currently not supported>
- check for attrib-bit-4 set -> goto Directory
- check for attrib-bit-3 set -> goto Volume ID
- check for attrib-bit-2 set -> goto Hidden/system
- check for attrib-bit-1 set -> goto Hidden/system
- -> assume that it is a normal 8.3 UPPERcase record
```
to be continued...

## 2nd Fat
2nd FAT
========================================
Also, note that there is a 2nd FAT, located directly after the 1st FAT.

```
FAT#1 location = $0800 + $0238
FAT#2 location = $0800 + $0238 + sectors_per_FAT
               = $0800 + $0238 + $03e6
               = $0E1E
 convert to BYTE-OFFSET
               = "         x bytes_per_sector
               = $00000E1E x $0200
               = $001C3C00'th byte
               = where the 2nd FAT is located.
```
This is verified below: (and 1st-FAT is same as 2nd-FAT)

From the first 4-bytes (32-bits) of the FAT,
which is the reserved cluster#0,
we see:
001c3c00  f8 ff ff 0f ($0ffffff8)
which tells us that:
f8 = it is a partitioned disk

From the second 4-bytes (32-bits) of the FAT,
which is the reserved cluster#1,
we see:
001c3c04  ff ff ff ff ($ffffffff)
which tells us that:
this is the end of the reserved section...

From the third 4-bytes (32-bits) of the FAT,
which is the cluster in location $02,
we see:
001c3c08  f8 ff ff 0f ($0ffffff8)
which tells us that:
this is the last cluster chain for the root directory,
so the root-directory does not span into another cluster.

From the fourth 4-bytes (32-bits) of the FAT,
which is the cluster chain in location $03,
we see:
001c3c0c  04 00 00 00 ($00000004)
which tells us that:
the data within cluster-#3 continues onto the cluster-$04.
```

Similarly, cluster-#4 -> cluster-#5

```
From the sixth 4-bytes (32-bits) of the FAT,
which is the sixth cluster chain (in location $05),
we see:
001c3c14  06 00 00 00 ($00000006)
which tells us that:
the data within cluster-#6 continues onto the cluster-$04.
```
... too hard, head hurts...

========================================
## Data Clusters
Data-clusters
========================================
And it can be calculated that the data-clusters follow directly from the 2nd FAT

```
FAT#2 location + sectors_per_FAT = $0E1E + $03e6
                                 = $1204
                                 = cluster_begin_lba (same result as above)
 convert to BYTE-OFFSET
                                 = "         x bytes_per_sector
                                 = $00001204 x $0200
                                 = $00240800'th byte
                                 = where the data-clusters begin.

```
