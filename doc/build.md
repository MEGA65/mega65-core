## Introduction

Thanks for justburn for his contributions on getting this file started!

The overall process from go-to-whoa takes about 60 minutes.

Basically you:

1. download the repository from github (5 mins),
1. compile the design into a bitstream (40 mins),
1. copy bitstream onto fpga board (5 mins).

Detailed instructions are below.

## Downloading Repository

The following is assumed:

1. you have linux, say, Ubuntu 15
1. you have git installed
```
$> sudo apt-get install git
```

Make a working directory for your project, we refer to that working directory as ```$GIT_ROOT```
```
$> cd $GIT_ROOT
```
Clone the following two git repositories into your working directory
```
$GIT_ROOT$> git clone https://github.com/MEGA65/mega65-core.git
$GIT_ROOT$> git clone https://github.com/gardners/Ophis.git
$GIT_ROOT$> 
```
You should now have two directories in your working directory, ie ```mega65-core``` and ```Ophis```.

Change directory into the ```mega65-core``` working directory.
```
$GIT_ROOT$> cd mega65-core
$GIT_ROOT$/mega65-core>
```

Currently, the MASTER branch (the default branch) is what you should compile.  

If you want to try a different (development) branch, do the following: ie to see/use the example banana branch, type ```$GIT_ROOT$/mega65-core> git checkout banana```. To revert back to the MASTER branch, type ```git checkout master```.

You may want to type ```git status``` or ```git branch``` to check what branch you have checked out.  

To make sure that you have the latest files, all you have to do is type:
``` 
$GIT_ROOT$/mega65-core> git pull
```
You are now ready to compile the design.

## Compiling

The following is assumed:

1. you have ```gcc``` installed (i have ver 5.2.1) (for compiling c.*)
1. you have ```make``` installed (i have 4.0) (for the makefile)
1. you have ```python``` installed (I have ver 2.7.10) (for some scripts ???)
1. you have ```libpng12-dev``` installed (for the image manipulation)
1. you have Xilinx ISE 14.7 WebPACK installed, with a valid licence

Overview of the compile process:  

1. pre-compile BEFORE running the ISE build
1. run the ISE build
1. optionally: see design run in fpga hardware (to do)
1. optionally: see design run in ghdl simulator (to do)

The following instructions are for running in the fpga.  

* As there are many end-use cases, i will not cover them all here, just the one that suits me.  
Someone else please document how the simulate function(s) work and what compile options etc.  

In your working directory: type the following
```
$GIT_ROOT$/mega65-core> ./compile.sh
$GIT_ROOT$/mega65-core> 
```
The ```compile.sh``` script performs two main tasks:  

1. calls the ```make``` command in the ```./src``` directory, which pre-compiles files used in the design, and then  
1. issues several commands to build the design using ISE commands.  

The image below may be useful to understand which file builds what file during the pre-compile.   
PLEASE NOTE that this file is now outdated.

During the pre-compile, ```Ophis``` may generate the following warnings, but these are OK:
```
WARNING: branch out of range, replacing with 16-bit relative branch
```

During the compile of the design (using ISE commands), many warnings are generated and listed in the relevant log-files. It was thought appropriate to hide these warnings from the user during compilation to make it easier to determine what part of the compile it is up to. If compile fails, (or completes), you are strongly encouraged to browse the log-files to examine the output generated during compile.  
There are two sets of log-files:

1. log files are generated by ISE commands, including *.XRPT, *.syr, *.log, etc, and
1. log files are generated by the ```./compile.sh``` script, ie: ```compile-<date><time>_N.log```, where N is one of the six stages of ISE compile.


## Modifying the design using ISE

Open ISE, and then ```Project -> Open``` and choose the ```"mega65"``` project.

You should be able to double-click on the ```"Generate Programming File"``` and a bit-stream should be created. (To-be-reconfirmed)  

NOTE that every compile of a bitstream that is destined for the FPGA, should be compiled using ```./compile.sh``` script, because this script ensures that the pre-comp files are generated correctly.

## Programming the FPGA via USB

To get the bitstream onto the FPGA, you can use either the USB-Stick or the SD-card. See next section for sdcard.  

To load the bitstream into the Nexys 4 DDR board via USB stick:

1. you need a USB stick formatted as FAT32
1. copy the bitstream to the root directory of the USB stick
```
$GIT_ROOT$/mega65-core> cp *.bit /media/sdc1
```

1. power OFF nexys board
1. place USB stick into the USB_HOST header
1. set jumper JP2 to USB
1. set jumper MODE to USB/SD
1. power ON nexys

Upon powerup, the bitstream is copied from USB into FPGA, then the FPGA executes it.

## Programming the FPGA via sdcard

Alternatively, the bitstream can be put onto an SD-card and that SD-card inserted into the Nexys 4 board. If you choose to use this method, just follow the above instructions re the use of the USB-stick, but change the "jumper JP2 to SD".  

The End.
