  ** MEGA65 core in slot 1 missing! **
{1}
 An error while replacing slot 0 can
 temporary brick your MEGA65, which can
 {7}ONLY{1} be reverted using a JTAG adapter
 or a MEGA65 core in slot 1.

 If you are unsure about this, make
 sure to first install a recent MEGA65
 Core into slot 1. Then test if you can
 use it to flash a core.

 Otherwise you can confirm that you own
 a {7}JTAG Adapter{1} and know how to use
 it to recover your Factory Core
 manually by typing CONFIRM, or press
 <RUN/STOP> to abort: {C}

 ** You are about to replace slot 0! **
{1}
If this process fails or is interrupted,
your {7}MEGA65 is softbricked{1}. Then you can
either use the JTAG recovery procedure
or wait ca. 30 sec until slot 1 starts.
For this you need to make sure that your
slot 1 MEGA65 core works correctly and
you can use the flasher inside that
core to reflash slot 0.

If you are unsure about any of this,
please contact us first!

 * I confirm that I am aware of the
   risks involved and like to proceed.

 * I confirm that I can start my MEGA65
   without the need of slot 0 or can
   access the flasher in slot 1.
