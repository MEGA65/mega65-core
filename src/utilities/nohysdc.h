 * Warning! This is very minimalistic to save precious space!

 * Limitations:
 *  - can only work with internal or external card (core limitation)
 *  - can only have one directory OR one file open!
 *  - can only read full 512 byte sectors, will not truncate the last sector!
 *  - has limited error handling
