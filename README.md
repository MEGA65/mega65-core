NOTE: (unsure if the below info is correct)  
To build this project you will need the following external files: 
(to be revised)  
MD5 (basic64.bin) = 57af4ae21d4b705c2991d98ed5c1f7b8  
MD5 (hesmonc000.bin) = faa17a10ebb74fd8aeb9005ac094cc81  
MD5 (kernel64.bin) = 39065497630802346bce17963f13c092  

The basic and kernel files are the C64 ROMs.  

hesmonc000.bin is an 8192 byte long file with the HESMON RAM $C000 version in the first 4KB.  
You can substitute this with an empty 8KB file if you wish.
