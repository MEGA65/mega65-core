1.0. Introduction

This  specification  describes  the  requirements for a low-cost 8-bit
microcomputer system with excellent graphic capabilities.


1.1. System Concept

The  C65  microcomputer  is a low-cost, versatile, competitive product
designed for the international home computer and game market.

The C65 is well suited for first time computer buyers, and provides an
excellent  upgrade  path  for  owners  of  the commercially successful
C64. The C65 is composed of concepts inherent in the C64 and C128.

The  purpose of the C65 is to modernize and revitalize the 10 year old
C64  market  while still taking advantage of the developed base of C64
software.  To  accomplish  this,  the  C65  will provide a C64 mode of
operation,  offering a reasonable degree of C64 software compatibility
and a moderate degree of add-on hardware and peripheral compatibility.
Compatibility can be sacrificed when it impedes enhanced functionality
and expandability, much as the C64 sacrificed VIC-20 compatibility.

It  is  anticipated that the many features and capabilities of the new
C65  mode  will  quickly  attract  the  attention  of  developers  and
consumers  alike,  thereby  revitalizing  the  low-end  home  computer
market.  The  C65  incorporates  features  that  are normally found on
today's more expensive machines, continuing the Commodore tradition of
maximizing  performance  for  the price. The C65 will provide many new
opportunities  for  third  party  software  and  hardware  developers,
including  telecommunications,  video,  instrument  control (including
MIDI), and productivity as well as entertainment software.

1.4. System Concerns


1.4.1. C64 Compatibility Issues

1.4.1.1. Software

C64 software compatibility is an important goal. To this end, when the
system  is in "C64 mode" the processor will operate at average 1.02MHz
speed  and  dummy "dead" cycles are emulated by the processor. The C64
ROM  is  the  same  except  for  patches to serial bus routines in the
kernel  (to  interface  built-in  drive), the removal of cassette code
(there  is  no  cassette  port), and patches to the C64 initialization
routines  to  boot C65 mode if there is no reason (eg., cartridges) to
stay in C64 mode.

Compatibility  with  C64  software  that uses previously unimplemented
6502  opcodes  (often associated with many copy-protection schemes) or
that implements extremely timing dependent "fast loaders" is iherently
impossible. Because the VIC-III timing is slightly different, programs
that  are  extremely  timing  dependant  may  not  work properly. Also
because  the  VIC-III does not change display modes until the end of a
character  line, programs that change displays based strictly upon the
raster  position  may not display things properly. The aspect ratio of
the  VIC-III display is slightly different than the VIC-II. The use of
a  1541-II disk drive (optional) will improve compatibility. C64 BASIC
2.2  compatibility  will be 100%  (within hardware constraints).  C128
BASIC   10  compatibility  will  be  moderate  (graphic  commands  are
different,  some  command parameters different, and there are many new
commands).

1.4.1.2. Hardware

C64  hardware  compatibility  is  limited. Serial bus and control port
devices  (mouse, joysticks, etc.) are fully supported.  Some user port
devices  are  supported  such as the newer (4-DIP switch) 1670 modems,
but  there's  no  9VAC  so  devices  which require 9VAC won't function
correctly.  The expansion port has additional pins (50 total), and the
pin  spacing is closer than the C64 (it's like the PLUS/4). An adaptor
("WIDGET")  will  be necessary to utilize C64 cartridges and expansion
port devices. Furthermore, timing differences between some C64 and C65
expansion port signals will affect many C64 expansion devices (such as
the 1764).


1.4.2. DOS Compatibility

The  built-in  C65  DOS is a subset of Commodore 1581 DOS. There is no
track  cache,  index  sensor, etc. To load and run existing 1541-based
applications,  the  consumer must add a 1541 drive to the system. Many
commercial  applications cannot be easily ported from 1541/5.25" media
to 1581/3.5" media, due to copy protection or "fast loaders". Most C64
applications  that  directly  address DOS memory, specific disk tracks
or  sectors, or rely on DOS job queues and timing characteristics will
not work with the built-in drive and new DOS.


1.4.3. Operating Modes

The  C65 powers up in the C64 mode. If there are no conditions present
which  indicate that C64 mode is desired, such as the C= key depressed
or   a   C64   cartridge  signature  found,  then  C65  mode  will  be
automatically  brought  into  context. Unlike the C128, "C6 4 mode" is
escapable.  Like  the  C128,  all  of the extended features of the C65
system  are  accessible  from "C64 mode" via custom software. Whenever
the  system initiates C64 mode, new VIC mode is always disabled except
when the DOS is required.

What  does  this mean?   Here is what the 64K memory map looks like in
various configurations (i.e., as seen by the processor):

C64 mode:      $E000-$FFFF     Kernel, Editor, Basic overflow area
---------      $D000-$DFFF     I/O and Color Nybbles, Character ROM
               $C000-$CFFF     Application RAM
               $A000-$BFFF     BASIC 2.2
               $0002-$9FFF     RAMLO.  VIC screen at $0400-$07FF
                               BASIC program & vars from $0800-$9FFF

C65 mode:      $E000-$FFFF     Kernel, Editor ROM code
---------      $D000-$DFFF     I/O and Color Bytes (CHRROM at $29000)
               $C000-$CFFF     Kernel Interface, DOS ROM overflow area
               $8000-$BFFF     BASIC 10.0 Graphics & Sprite ROM code
               $2000-$7FFF     BASIC 10.0 ROM code
               $0002-$1FFF     RAMLO.  VIC screen at $0800-$0FFF
                               BASIC prgs mapped from $02000-$0FF00
                               BASIC vars mapped from $12000-$1F7FF

C65 DOS mode:  $E000-$FFFF     Kernel, Editor ROM code
-------------  $D000-$DFFF     I/O (CIA's mapped out), Color Bytes
               $C800-$CFFF     Kernel Interface
               $8000-$C3FF     DOS ROM code
               $2000-$7FFF      (don't care)
               $0000-$1FFF     DOS RAMHI

C65 Monitor:   $E000-$FFFF     Kernel, Editor ROM code
------------   $D000-$DFFF     I/O and Color Bytes
               $C000-$CFFF     Kernel Interface
               $8000-$BFFF      (don't care)
               $6000-$7FFF     Monitor ROM code
               $0002-$5FFF     RAMLO

It's  done  this  way  for  a  reason.  The  CPU  MAPPER restricts the
programmer  to  one offset for each 32Kbyte half of a 64Kbyte segment.
For  one chunk of ROM to MAP in another chunk with a different offset,
it  must  do  so  into  the  other  half  of  memory  from which it is
executing.  The  OS  does  this  by  never mapping the chunk of ROM at
$C000-$DFFF, which allows this chunk to contain the Interface/MAP code
and I/O (having I/O in context is usually desirable, and you can't map
I/O  anyhow).  The  Interface/MAP ROM can be turned on and off via VIC
register $30,  bit 5 (ROM @ $C000),  and therefore does not need to be
mapped itself.  Generally,  OS functions  (such as the Kernel, Editor,
and  DOS)  live in the upper 32K half of memory, and applications such
as BASIC  or  the  Monitor)  live in the lower 32K half.  For example,
when  Monitor  mode is entered,  the OS maps out BASIC and maps in the
Monitor.  Each  has ready access to the OS,  but no built-in access to
each other.  When a DOS call is made,  the OS overlays itself with the
DOS  (except  for  the  magical  $C000 code)  in the upper 32K half of
memory,  and  overlays  the application area with DOS RAM in the lower
32K half of memory.

Notes:

1/ The  cursor  keys  are special -- the shifted cursor keys appear as
   separate  keys,  but  in  actuality pressing them generates a SHIFT
   plus  the normal cursor code,  making them totally compatible with,
   and therefore functional in, C64 mode.

2/ There are a total of 77 keys, two of which are locking keys.

3/ The NATIONAL keyboards are similar,  and their layout and operation
   is identical to their C128 implementation.

Keyboard Notes:

1/ The  64 keys under C0 through C7 occupy the same matrix position as
   in the C/64,  as does the RESTORE key.  Including SHIFT-LOCK, there
   are 66 such keys.

2/ The  extended  keyboard consists of the 8 keys under the C8 output.
   Counting the CAPS-LOCK key, there are 9 new keys. The C/64 does not
   scan these keys.

3/ The new CURSOR LEFT and CURSOR UP keys simulate a CURSOR plus RIGHT
   SHIFT key combination.

4/ The  keyboard mechanism will be mechanically similar to that of the
   C128.
